## Bubble Sort

Most basic sorting algorithm. Never use. Just for learning and etc.This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.

## Logic

The algorithm compares each element of the array and replaces the changes. Each pass, the largest element "bubbles" down to the end of the array. This process performs a sort pass at every opportunity.

## O(n)

When we calculate O(n) we are lookin loops
There are two loops in here so O(n)\*\* .
