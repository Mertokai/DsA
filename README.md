## Algorithms and Data Structures Repository

### Introduction

This repository contains various data structures and algorithms. Before getting started, make sure you have a package manager installed (pnpm, npm, or yarn).

To run the tests for the implemented algorithms, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm test
# or
pnpm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Which queue should you keep track ?

This repository initially focuses on sorting algorithms, so you can start with them. I will continue updating the repository with new algorithms over time.

## Note

All this things was wroted by typescript. You shouldn't concern about typescript you can write pure javascript in typescript I wrote all types for you
